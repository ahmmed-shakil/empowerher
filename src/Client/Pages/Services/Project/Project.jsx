            controlling resources to deliver a successful project. Project
            management is essential for businesses of all sizes and across all
            industries, and it plays a significant role in achieving the desired
            outcome.

            Project management involves a scope of activities, from defining

            timelines. Effective project management requires careful planning
            and execution, as skillfully as the ability to adjust and adapt as
